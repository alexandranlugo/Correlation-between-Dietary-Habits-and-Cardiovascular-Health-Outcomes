# Correlation Between Dietary Habits and Cardiovascular Health Outcomes

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between dietary habits and cardiovascular health outcomes. The analysis is conducted using Python and several data science libraries, presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

- **Correlation_between_Dietary_Habits_and_Cardiovascular_Health_Outcomes.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Installation

To run the notebook locally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranlugo/Correlation-between-Dietary-Habits-and-Cardiovascular-Health-Outcomes.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Correlation-between-Dietary-Habits-and-CV-Health-Outcomes
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook**:
   In the Jupyter interface, open the `Correlation_between_Dietary_Habits_and_Cardiovascular_Health_Outcomes.ipynb` file.

5. **Run the analysis**:
   Follow the cells in the notebook to understand and reproduce the analysis. Each cell should be executed in order to ensure that the dependencies and data are properly loaded.

## Analysis

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loading dietary and cardiovascular health data.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values and data normalization.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics and data visualization to understand the data.
4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculating correlation coefficients between dietary habits and cardiovascular health outcomes.
5. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Using linear regression to model the relationship between dietary habits and cardiovascular health outcomes.
6. **Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations to represent the findings.

## Results

The results section of the notebook includes:
- Correlation matrices to show the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- Scatter plots and regression lines to visualize the relationships.
- Interpretations of the statistical significance of the findings.
